    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the 'leoncvlt/loconotion' repository.
      # This provides the 'loconotion.py' script and its specific 'requirements.txt' file.
      - name: Checkout loconotion
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          repository: leoncvlt/loconotion
          path: loconotion # Clones Loconotion into a directory named 'loconotion'

      # Step 2: Checkout your own 'ravelforguitar' repository.
      # This gives the workflow access to your 'site.toml' configuration file
      # and is where the generated static site files will be created.
      - name: Checkout this repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          path: pages_repo # Clones your repo into a directory named 'pages_repo'

      # Step 3: Install all necessary Python dependencies for Loconotion.
      # This is the most critical part where we ensure all libraries are correctly installed.
      - name: Install Loconotion dependencies
        run: |
          # Upgrade pip (Python's package installer) to its latest version first.
          python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

          # Install all base dependencies listed in Loconotion's own requirements.txt file.
          # This will install 'chromedriver-autoinstaller' at the version specified by Loconotion.
          pip install -r loconotion/requirements.txt

          # Force an upgrade of 'chromedriver-autoinstaller' to a newer, known-good version (0.6.4).
          # This resolves potential compatibility issues with the environment.
          pip install --upgrade chromedriver_autoinstaller==0.6.4

      # Step 4: Run the Loconotion script to generate your static website.
      # It will read your 'site.toml' and scrape your Notion page(s).
      - name: Run Loconotion
        run: |
          # This path and command appears to be what the 'leoncvlt/loconotion' project expects
          # when run as a sub-module or specific entry point.
          # The --chromedriver chromedriver flag and "pages_repo/site.toml" arguments are kept.
          python3 loconotion/loconotion --chromedriver chromedriver "pages_repo/site.toml"
        # The 'working-directory' is set to the root of the runner's workspace,
        # so 'loconotion/loconotion' can be resolved correctly relative to it.
        working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}

      # Step 5: Push the newly generated static website files to your 'gh-pages' branch.
      # This makes your website live on GitHub Pages.
      - name: Push to GitHub pages
        run: |

          # This script handles the Git operations to push the 'dist' folder to 'gh-pages'.
          # We pass environment variables to configure the deploy.sh script:
          # - GIT_DEPLOY_DIR: Specifies that the generated files are in the 'dist' folder.
          # - GIT_DEPLOY_BRANCH: Sets the target branch to 'gh-pages'.
          # - GIT_DEPLOY_REPO: Provides the repository URL with the necessary token for authentication.
          GIT_DEPLOY_DIR=dist \
          GIT_DEPLOY_BRANCH=gh-pages \
          GIT_DEPLOY_REPO="https://${{ github.token }}@github.com/${{ github.repository }}.git" ./loconotion/deploy.sh
        # This step's 'working-directory' is 'pages_repo' because that's where the 'dist' folder (containing
        # your generated site) is located, and where the deploy.sh script will operate from relative to its path.
        working-directory: pages_repo
